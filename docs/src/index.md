### Zeebe is a cloud-native workflow engine for microservices orchestration

* Define workflows graphically in BPMN 2.0
* Choose any gRPC-supported programming language
* Deploy with Docker and Kubernetes (in the cloud or on-premises)
* Build workflows that react to events from Apache Kafka and other messaging platforms
* Scale horizontally to handle very high throughput
* Fault tolerance (no relational database required)
* Export workflow data for monitoring and analysis
* Engage with an active community
