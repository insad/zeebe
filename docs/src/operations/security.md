# Security Configuration

Zeebe supports two security features that you should be aware of:
* **[Authentication](/operations/authentication.html)** - allows you to secure communication between clients and gateways;
* **[Authorization](/operations/authorization.html)** - allows you to supply access credentials to the client so these can be validated by a reverse proxy placed before the gateway.
