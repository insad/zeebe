# Zeebe Client Libraries

Applications that leverage the Zeebe broker need to be written using a client library that implements the Zeebe gRPC API.

Zeebe provides officially supported [Java](/clients/java-client) and [Go](/clients/go-client) clients, and there are many excellent [community-supported clients](/clients/other-clients) available for other programming languages.
