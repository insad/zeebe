# Operate User Guide

Operate is a tool for monitoring and troubleshooting workflow instances running in Zeebe. 

In addition to providing visibility into active and completed workflow instances, Operate also makes it possible to carry out key operations such as resolving [incidents](/reference/incidents.html) and updating workflow instance variables.

In the [Getting Started tutorial](/getting-started/), we walk through how to install and run Operate and how to use it to monitor workflow instances. In this Operate User Guide, we’ll cover some of Operate’s more advanced features.

Because Operate can be a helpful tool when getting started with Zeebe and building an initial proof of concept, we make it available under a developer license for **free, non-production use**. [You can find the developer license here](https://zeebe.io/legal/operate-evaluation-license/). There are no restrictions under this license when it comes to the length of the evaluation period or the available feature set _as long as you use Operate in non-production environments only._ 

Operate is also available for production use (with support) under an enterprise license. If you'd like to learn more about an enterprise license for Operate, [please contact us here.](https://zeebe.io/enterprise/)
